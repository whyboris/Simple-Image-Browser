# Simple Image Browser

Simple Image Browser is a simple way to browse your photos on your computer (Windows, Mac, Linux).

## Development

This project is WIP.

How to start:

- `npm install` to install
- `npm start` to develop
- `npm run electron:build` to build

Main dependencies in use:

| Library          | Version   | Date     | Comment                                           |
| ---------------- | --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Angular          | v13.2.4   | Feb 2022 |                                                   |
| Angular-CLI      | v13.2.4   | Feb 2022 |                                                   |
| Electron         | v14.0.0   | Feb 2022 | (internally uses Node `v16.13.0` and Chromium 98) |
| Electron Builder | v22.14.13 | Feb 2022 |                                                   |

- I recommend using the same version of `node` as _Electron_ uses internally, but version 14 or above should work.
