# Simple Image Browser

Simple Image Browser is a simple way to browse your photos on your computer (Windows, Mac, Linux).

## Development

This project is WIP.

How to start:

- `npm install` to install
- `npm start` to develop
- `npm run electron:build` to build

Main dependencies in use:

| Library          | Version | Date      | Comment                                            |
| ---------------- | :-----: | --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Angular          | 16      | Sept 2023 |                                                    |
| Angular-CLI      | 16      | Sept 2023 |                                                    |
| Electron         | 26      | Sept 2023 | (internally uses Node `v18.16.1` and Chromium 116) |
| Electron Builder | 24      | Sept 2023 |                                                    |

- I recommend using the same (or higher) version of `node` as _Electron_ uses internally ([fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) lets you switch easily)

## Thank you
