# Simple Image Browser

Simple Image Browser is a simple way to browse your photos on your computer (Windows, Mac, Linux).

## Development

This project is WIP.

How to start:

- `npm install` to install
- `npm start` to develop
- `npm run electron:build` to build

Main dependencies in use:

| Library          | Version  | Date            | Comment                                           |
| ---------------- | -------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Angular          | v12.0.0  | May 2021        |                                                   |
| Angular-CLI      | v12.0.0  | May 2021        |                                                   |
| Electron         | v12.0.1  | March 2021      | (internally uses Node `v14.16.0` and Chromium 89) |
| Electron Builder | v22.10.5 | March 2021      |                                                   |

- **Node**: I recommend using the same version as _Electron_ uses internally, but version 10 or above should work.
