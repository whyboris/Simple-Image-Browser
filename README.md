# Simple Image Browser

Simple Image Browser is a simple way to browse your photos on your computer (Windows, Mac, Linux).

## Development

This project is WIP.

How to start:

- `npm install` to install
- `npm start` to develop
- `npm run electron:build` to build

Main dependencies in use:

| Library          | Version   | Date     | Comment                                            |
| ---------------- | --------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Angular          | v15.1.2   | Jan 2023 |                                                    |
| Angular-CLI      | v15.1.3   | Jan 2023 |                                                    |
| Electron         | v22.1.0   | Jan 2023 | (internally uses Node `v16.17.1` and Chromium 108) |
| Electron Builder | v23.6.0   | Jan 2023 |                                                    |

- I recommend using the same version of `node` as _Electron_ uses internally, but version 16 or above should work.
